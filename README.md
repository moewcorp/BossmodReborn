## Fork for CN client
- A fork for players on the CN client can be found on https://github.com/44451516-ff14/BossmodRebornCN.
- It is not directly supported by the Combat Reborn Team, so any bugs exclusive to that fork need to be fixed by the fork maintainer.
- Bugs that likely affect both BossmodReborn and the CN fork can still be reported to the Combat Reborn Team.
