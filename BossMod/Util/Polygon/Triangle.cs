// currently we use Clipper2 library (based on Vatti algorithm) for boolean operations and Earcut.net library (earcutting) for triangulating
// note: the major user of these primitives is bounds clipper; since they operate in 'local' coordinates, we use WDir everywhere (offsets from center) and call that 'relative polygons' - i'm not quite happy with that, it's not very intuitive
