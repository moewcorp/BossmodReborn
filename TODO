immediate plans
- refactor replay history feature
- remove 'ex' variants of strategies, replace with cooldown/effect functors, write a converter
- add strategy param, use for 'apply unless already active' flavours of utility strategies
- get rid of legacyxxx
- ishape
-- rasterization should automatically deal with 0.03 position imprecision (and angle imprecision?..)

general:
- horizontal timeline / cooldown planner
- cdplanner should use real cds
- assignments per ui order rather than per player + class-specific assignments
- restore view-timeline to module ui
- module packs
-- dlls, loaded as usual
-- hotreload - just discard old version and load new one
-- distributed as github releases, on startup query latest version and download if different
-- rate limit gh requests to 1/hour
-- dialog to add warns about arbitrary code execution
-- update bm/rm registries on reload
- add non-entities to worldstate
- proper logging
- consistently use Color instead of uint
- refactor window system to dispose stuff properly and avoid CS1806 and `_ = new...` pattern
- diagnostic to detect readonly mutable collections
- introduce 'Game' class that would contain dalamud services and stuff like AMEx/IDScramble, instead of statics, to avoid uncontrolled access to game state (won't help with CS tho)
- better timing tracking for: statuses, gauges, cooldowns, cast times, anim lock, ...
- constrain bossmodules to zone id (e.g. for T04)
- revise module categories - consider merging fates/hunts/quests/gold saucer?/pvp? into outdoor?/casual?
- debug utility to play action animations, spawn actors, play vfx, etc...
- encounter hints (to show before pull)
- zone modules: replay visualization
- zone modules: module info ui
- refactor ipc/dtr
- questbattles
- autoautos: remove target-setting shenanigans in ual, instead deal with disabling autos in hook
- pathfinding can cut corners by entering aoe (los check returns safe) - is that good?..
- alt style for player indicator on arena
- MAO for pomanders holsters etc
- ManualActionQueueTweak.Push should not special case gcds?..
- review enemy prios usage - should framework do anything about any prios? like taunt at -4...
- freeze special mode implementation
- find a way to make ActionDefinition fields readonly
- better palacepal interop (download db asynchronously and load once on plugin init)
- move ai hint execution to dedicated class
- obstacle maps - download from github

ai:
- forcedmovement with large leeway and casting...
- nav decision delay
- review TODO[cast-time]
- remove old ai
- revise misdirection, remove threshold hint
- knockbacks, forced movement, pyretic/freezing, etc components should update max-cast hint
- hardcoded cdplanner targeting track should be moved to a aimodule
- utility modules / planner - how should planned casts work?
- high-level follow/assist module for multibox

boss modules:
- timers
- wipe should not fast forward all phases
- fail log
- boss module config presets/profiles
- jeuno
-- a11: ai hints for spikes+uppercut
-- a14: complex aoe hints (cthonic, battlements)
-- a14: dark nebula kb hints
- [dt ex3] p2 ice bridges
- [dt ex1] the cleave is still telegraphed a bit too wide
- [dsr] for p2 thordan cleavebuster the telegraph on the minimap is narrower than the actual hitbox

autorotation:
- global strategy for track
- bulk override priorities?
- preset/plan editors should properly react to external changes
- actiondefinitions
-- action transforms?.. (combos, adjustment)
-- adjusted casttime/cooldown/???
- action history/queue visualization
- simulation in replay analysis
- spell out shared cooldowns in actiondefinitions comments instead of group?
- delete/rework commonstate/legacy
- delete autorotationlegacy dir
- dot/regen server tick tracking
- brd
-- take traits into account (ij proccing rs, ea proccing repertoire)
-- better handle bad misalignment (see JeunoTheFirstWalk_BRD100_VeynHumanmale_2025_01_05_20_42_19.log)
- drg
-- priorities...
-- dragon sight is a true north
-- cd planning
- war
-- simulate gauge changes (message can arrive few frames after ActionEffect...)
-- low-level rotation - improve berserk delay logic
- whm:
-- resurrect (6.1 and later changes)
-- planner
-- smart-targeting for ST actions

ai:
- improve healing AI: analyze incoming dps
- movement: know time left, distance to travel => decide whether to swiftcast or slidecast or use movement rotation

world rendering:
- danger zones (modify action vfx?)
- arrows

replay encounter analysis:
- tether & debuff passing range
- pull range

misc:
- memory show/watch utility
- clip circles to arena bounds...
- draw target max-melee and boss positioning hints?..
- assignments/config sharing (webservice?)

notes on targeting:
- aoe (e.g. cone) will hit if shape intersects target's hitbox; for players it is == 0.5
- max melee range is raw range (usually 3) + source hitbox radius + target hitbox radius; for players this usually means 3.5 + target hitbox
- charge/onslaught will bring player to source hitbox radius + target hitbox radius range, or leave in place if current distance is less

getAjustedRecastTime:
- type: item => calculation, non-spell => 5000, spell => continue...
- no adjustment or cdgroup is [76-79] -> recast100ms * 100; otherwise start with that and adjust...
- trait adjustment: recastMS += 100 * trait->Value (per trait)
- if maxcharges > 1 => return recast (adjusted by additive traits)
- recastMS = adjustRecastTimeByStatusesAndStats(recastMS)
-- if non pvp:
--- weaponskill/spell:
---- spdMod = 1000 + 130 * (base - spdattr) / levelmod (min 0)
---- recastMS *= spdMod / 1000
---- recastMS *= hasteattr / 100
---- min 1500
--- if gcd and have sm flag 18: recastMS += recastMS * sum-status-param(22) / 100; min 500 (ie riddle of fire)
-- else: tbd...
- some special pvp checks -> fallback to raw base
- MCH if have rapid fire (853) status -> override to 100*param
- DNC overrides
- etc special overrides
